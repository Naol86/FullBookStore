### Linear Bounded Automaton (LBA)

A Linear Bounded Automaton (LBA) is a type of Turing machine with a tape that is limited to a length proportional to the input size. This means the machine can only use a fixed amount of space based on the length of the input.

### Context-Sensitive Grammar (CSG)

A Context-Sensitive Grammar (CSG) is a formal grammar where production rules are of the form \( \alpha A \beta \rightarrow \alpha \gamma \beta \), with \( \gamma \) being at least as long as \( A \). This ensures that the production rules do not decrease the length of the string being produced.

### Context-Sensitive Languages (CSLs)

Context-Sensitive Languages are languages that can be generated by a CSG. These languages are exactly those that can be recognized by an LBA.

### Relationship

- **LBA**: Can recognize context-sensitive languages using tape space limited to a linear function of the input length.
- **CSG**: Generates context-sensitive languages using length-non-decreasing rules.
- **CSLs**: The languages recognized by LBAs and generated by CSGs.

In summary, context-sensitive languages are exactly the languages that can be accepted by Linear Bounded Automata and generated by Context-Sensitive Grammars.
